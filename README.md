# Movies ETL


## Overview of the analysis:

The company Amazing Prime wants to have the dataset updated on a daily basis. This code creates an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. The code uses one function that takes in the three files Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating dataâ€”and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
